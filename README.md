# OVERVIEW

This is a readme file for the peer assessment for the "Getting and Cleaning 
Data" course on Coursera.


# FILES

The coding file "run_analysis.R":
- Reads in all the raw data sets
- Does initial cleaning
- Combines the data sets
- Subsets the data set to select only means and stds
- Makes the data tidy
- Writes the tidy data set to working directory

The "CodeBook.md" file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that were done to conduct the overall analysis.
